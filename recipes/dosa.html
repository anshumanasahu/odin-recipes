        <h3>Prepare the batter</h3>

        <li>Soaking: Rinse the rice and urad dal separately. Soak the rice and fenugreek seeds in water for 6 hours. Soak the urad dal separately for 4 hours.</li>
        <li>Grinding: Grind the urad dal into a smooth and fluffy batter using minimal water. Grind the rice into a slightly coarse paste.</li>
        <li>Mixing: Combine both batters in a large bowl, add salt, and mix thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Fermenting: Leave the batter in a warm place for 8-12 hours or overnight to ferment until it doubles in volume.</li>
        <li>Dilute the batter slightly with water to achieve a pourable consistency.</li>

        <h3>Prepare the Masala (Potato Filling):</h3>
        <li>Heat oil in a pan. Add mustard seeds and let them splutter.</li>
        <li>Add curry leaves, green chilies, and sliced onions. Saut√© until the onions are soft and translucent.</li>
        <li>Add turmeric powder and mashed boiled potatoes. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Add salt, chopped coriander leaves, and optional lemon juice. Mix and cook for 2-3 minutes. Set aside. </li>

        <h3>Cook the Dosa:</h3>
        <li>Heat a flat pan, pour a ladleful of batter, and spread it in a circular motion. Drizzle oil or ghee</li>
        <li>Cook until crisp and golden, then fold and serve with chutney and sambar</li>
